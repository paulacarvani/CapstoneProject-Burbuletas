      <h3 align="center"> Team </h3>
      <ul align="center">
        <p><a href="http://github.com/122-63">Andrea Angola</a> - Front-End</p>
        <p><a href="http://github.com/paulacarvani">Paula Carvajal</a> - Back-End</p>

        <p><a href="http://github.com/nel10">Shannel Bejarano</a> - DevOps</p>
        <p>All this roles was decided for lottery, because we, as a team, think that we can encourage any role, like in a productive world sometimes you can choose, and another times you can't, every one of us take the time to approach the task needed to have a MVP like as we want to at the end</p>
      </ul>

    <h3> Technologies </h3>
    <p><i> The technologies list below are the one we choose, but this can be updated in the way of develop the MVP</i></p>
    <h4><b> Front-End </b></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>React</li>
        <p> It is an open source library that has one of the largest communities of developers in the fornt-End, it is supported by large companies such as its creator Facebook and others like Netflix, Airbnb and more.
        Its learning curve is between Angular and Vue, being Angular the most complex.
        It has reactive programming and component-based development that facilitates code reuse.
        It is better in forms and validations.</p>
    </ul>
    <h4><b> Back-End </b></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
      <li>NodeJS</li>
      <li>Express</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><b> DataBases </b></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>MongoDB</li>
      <li>Moongose</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><b> DevOps </b></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>OS Ubuntu <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Logo-ubuntu_cof-orange-hex.svg/1200px-Logo-ubuntu_cof-orange-hex.svg.png" width= 1% height= 1%></li>
      <li>AWS server</li>
      <li>Nginx web server</li>
      <li>UFW firewall</li>
      <li>Datadog monitoring</li>  
    </ul>
    <h4><b> Another alternatives evaluated </b></h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Front-End:Vue</b></li>
      <p>Vue has a low learning curve that makes it ideal for the application, but it does not have a large community and for employment issues it falls short.</p>
      <li><b>Back-End:Python and Flask</b></li>
      <p>This option was one of the first because the previous experience with this technologies,
      but searching more opportunities to learn another languages and frameworks we decided for NodeJs, also because the community and documentation available.</p>
      <li><b>DataBases: MySQL </b></li>
      <p>MySQL in the beginning we thought about working with MySQL because we had already worked with it but we decided for MongoDB because the individual documents have their own structure. In this way, it is possible to create new fields with any value, while for a relational database like MySQL, a complete restructuring is needed. Although with MongoDB the key must be unique within a document, it is possible for it to appear in other documents, which is not possible in MySQL databases and must be regulated by means of joins between the different tables, which in MongoDB can optionally be created in the form of embedded documents or references.
      So it is a wonderful opportunity to work with MongoDB.</p>
      <li><b>DevOps</b></li>
      <p>The other alternative I have for the development and deployment of our web application is DigitalOcean as it is very prominent among private companies and generates lower cost compared to the aws server.</p>

    <h3> Challenge </h3>
    <p>This project was designed to solve a need for an entrepreneurship, which seeks to publicize its products beyond social networks.</p>
    <p>We don't want to create a new entrepreneurship, just take one that already exists</p>
    <p>With this web aplication we want to help not only the owner of the business, also the clients, who at the end are going to be the ones who can navigate in this web, choosing his products in a wish list, make contact with the sales person and by the way known another products</p>
    <p>For the location of the entrepreneurship, this aplication is first think for the citys of Sevilla and Roldanillo in Valle del Cauca - Colombia, expecting that can grow to a national level.</p>

    <h3> Risks </h3>
    <h4><i>Technical risks</i></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>A new challenge to manage new technologies and the connections of them</li>
      <li>The risk of non response in the server</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><i>Non technical risks.</i></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Time management in the team</li>
      <li>Don’t complete with the planned for the MVP</li>
    </ul>
